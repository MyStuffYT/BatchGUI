# BatchGUI
This is a GUI made in Batch and VBS.

# How it was made
So first: It creates a .vbs file with a GUI
It runs the VBS file
Windows caches the entire file and runs it.
After it deletes the VBS file when it's ran!

# Can it do the impossible?
Yes, It uses VBS.
And with VBS you can run commands
With commands you can use curl to send/download online stuff

# What do i do to edit the source code?
You figure it out yourself, I'm not spending time to keep doing this.
